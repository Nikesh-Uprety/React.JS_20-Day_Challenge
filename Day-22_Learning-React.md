# Setting up the project file
- After downloading the project file from the Linkedin Learning course, there are two directories front-end and back-end.

### The total energy was lost, while trying to run those exercise file locally in my devices, due to which I couldn't focus on the course, Finally after 2 hrs of trying finally I was able to run those files , the main issue was in the backend file,
### I fixed the issue by adding the .js extension to each of the file imported, as the package.json file includes type:module, this was the main issue which I finally figure out, and after that I I installed the monogoDB and all issues were solved!
