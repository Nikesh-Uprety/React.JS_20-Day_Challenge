# Accessibility in React
> Accessibility in web browsers refers to the design and implementation of web content and applications to ensure that they can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities or impairments. This involves creating content that can be perceived, understood, navigated, and interacted with by people with different types of disabilities, such as visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, or neurological.
## Semantic tags,
- Semantic tags, also known as semantic HTML or semantic elements, are HTML tags that provide meaningful information about the content they enclose, rather than just describing how the content should look. In other words, semantic tags describe the structure and purpose of the content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand and parse the information.

- As HTML 5 introduces, more sementic tags such that,
```javascript
<nav>
<articles>
<main>
<section>
<footer>
```
- Semantic tags also make it easier for other developers to understand the structure and purpose of the content, which can improve collaboration and reduce development time.
